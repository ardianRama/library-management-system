A REST API built with Java 21 and Spring Boot for managing a digital library system.

The application supports two main roles:
- **Admin** — full control over books, users and loans
- **User** — can browse, borrow and manage their own loans

The system integrates with the Open Library API, allowing admins to search for books externally before adding them to the local database.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
- [Java 21](https://adoptium.net/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ardianRama/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example`.

### 3. Set application environment variables

Set the required environment variables in your shell or IDE run configuration. See `application-example.properties` for reference.

### 4. Start the database

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Run the application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> **💡 Tip:** The database starts empty. Use the `/api/books/search/external` 
> endpoint to search for books via the Open Library API, then import them 
> using `/api/books/import`.

## 📖 API Documentation

The API is documented with Swagger UI, which is the recommended way to explore and test all available endpoints. Once the application is running, open:

[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

---

## 🔐 Authentication

The API is protected by Spring Security. When accessing Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`, you will be prompted to log in before you can explore and test the endpoints.

To log in as admin, use the credentials you configured via environment variables.

The `/api/auth/register` endpoint is publicly accessible.

> **💡 Tip:** To create a user account, use a tool like Postman to call `/api/auth/register` directly, or log in as admin and use the `/api/auth/register` endpoint in Swagger UI.
